# Connect 4 game

**Instead of XNA, this game uses [Monogames](https://www.mongames.net/index.php)**, a fork of XNA, that works the same.  
We used it because we were using Visual Studio 2022, which does **not** support XNA anymore.

A simple Connect 4 game with two game mode : 
- Player VS Player
- Player VS AI

# Controls
- Arrows RIGHT / LEFT : Select your column  
- Arrow DOWN : Drop the coin into the selected column  
- ESCAPE : Go back to the main menu or quit the game
